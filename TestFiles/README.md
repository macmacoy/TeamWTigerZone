Test Methods

This folder contains a collection of test files used utilized in the development of Team W's iteration of tigerzone

Each file represents a specific method critical to the realization of the game, whether it be for score calculation or server interaction.

Tests are typically performed by compiling the method in g++ and then running with ./test

We accept a test as successful based on the information returned from the program. Our display function shows us the game flow, and thus we can assess success if the desired outcome is returned. This allowed for more intimiate testing, team members effectively locate issues through progressive testing.
